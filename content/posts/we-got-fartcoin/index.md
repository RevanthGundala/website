Blockchains' speed of growth has been disappointing. People thought Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchains were going to be the next big movement in tech. We thought the internet and financial system would be rewritten by now. Unfortunately, there's still a long way to go.

### Misaligned Incentives
One of the major hurdles to blockchains providing real utility is misaligned incentives. In an interview with Tim Sweeney and Neal Stephenson about the Metaverse, Tim Sweeney said this about crypto:
> *It strikes me as very unfortunate that it didn't have another couple decades to be nurtured in the purely nerd community before it was adopted as a financial instrument, because the currency has been greatly undermined by speculation and scams and regulatory uncertainty and so on.*

*— Tim Sweeney, from [Matthew Ball's interview](https://www.matthewball.co/all/sweeneystephenson)* 

As soon as you introduce money into a system, you introduce a whole new set of actors who view the technology primarily as a way to make money. You get the average influencer pump and dump - even from the [President](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1880446012168249386)! - large scandals like FTX, and the daily scams from a random guy in Discord. Beyond purely bad actors, you get another misaligned incentive. The leader of the country isn't set in stone, so everyone wants to be Uncle Sam.

Everyone is fighting to become "the blockchain"—the foundational platform that accrues fees from every app and piece of infrastructure built on top of it. Why? Because a piece of every single transaction that takes place on the platform goes to the platform's owners. This is where the "app-chain" thesis comes in. Why deploy your application on a chain where you have to pay fees to the base layer when you could deploy your own and keep the revenue!

Blockchains that co-exist with one another are directly in competition. The idea of having L2s that all do the same thing doesn't make sense. 
> *TR = P X Q*

Total Revenue = Price Times Quantity. We can say that the total revenue is similar to the total value. As soon as you have different prices and different quantities across different chains, you get different values. With different values, users and capital will naturally converge towards the place with the most value.  

No one wants 10 different prices for a particular crypto, a stock, or a house. We want have 1 chain with all of the value, AKA the single source of truth. However, like I mentioned earlier, everyone wants to be the truth. And until we have one winner, people will continue fighting and competing, slowing down the rate of progress.
My view is we'll likely end up in an oligopoly similar to the cloud or the current race of AI model providers.

A core promise of crypto is to align incentives so that parties who do not trust each other can behave in a way that benefits the user. Usually, competition is good for the end user. That's because apples at one grocery store are the same as at another. But it's not the same when the value of an "apple" (an asset) depends on everything else that exists in the "store" (the chain).

The largest breakout apps in the crypto ecosystem ironically showcase both sides of the coin. Pump.fun showcases misaligned incentives, while Polymarket shows aligned incentives. One shows people utilizing misaligned incentives to make money, while the other shows how aligned incentives can showcase "truth". There's a lot of people that say one form of speculation is "good" while the other isn't. I've made the argument that the rate of blockchains growth is slow because of misaligned incentives, but I am not someone who believes in the binary. Whether it's good or not is not a question of what we should promote, but rather an inherent truth to the ecosystem. 
### The downsides of decentralization
Lastly, centralization is simply much easier than decentralization. In a world with no tradeoffs, decentralization is objectively better than centralization. However, we live in the real world. Most blockchains use some sort of consensus where a large majority must agree on an action. Because you need such a sizable majority, it takes a lot of time to make changes. Consider Ethereum, which is considered one of the most decentralized blockchains at this point. It's close to 8000 [EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/all) as of today. This process is far too slow to make rapid change. One could argue this is a feature, not a bug, because of the tradeoffs of decentralization. But I think a better example of showcasing these tradeoffs is when it comes to hacks. We've seen countless [hacks](https://rekt.news/) which have deterred people away from seeing blockchains as a useful and safe technology. The ancient Romans had a republic but also had a policy that allowed them to appoint a dictator in times of crisis. I believe blockchains should have something similar: a way to determine that a crisis exists and, when it does, shift decentralized power to a few nodes to speed up decision-making and lead to better outcomes. Consider the recent Cetus hack on Sui.

Many people argued that this was not a good thing. This set a precedent for blockchains like Sui, that weren't full decentralized. This directly goes against the blockchain ethics and ideals of censorship resistance. Others argued that this was similar to the DAO hack in Ethereum, and that ultimately this was a good thing for its users. However, Sui has mentioned that their path is towards ultimate decentralization. 

My point is, what happens when you reach that stage? The end game of decentralization? We've seen Ethereum hacks, and nothing can be done because it is decentralized. Is that what people really want? Do people want no way to reverse hacks? Do people want slow change?

I spent a lot of time interested in the blockchain ecosystem, but for the past year I have taken a step back. There's a lot of problems to be solved and I don't know the solution to most of them. Whether the current state of blockchains is the end game or not, they have given us very important ideals that a future society needs to be built on. There's a lot of smart people working on these problems, so I'm hopeful something good will come of it, but only time will tell.
