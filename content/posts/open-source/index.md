How do we fix open source? Software is the only industry where we can just pull something off the shelf for free and directly use it in the products we make. This allows software to move extremely fast compared to the rest of the world. However, there's obviously a lot of downsides to this.

One of the best programmers of all time Linus Torvalds, created two of the best open source projects of all time. What did he get for it? Not much compared to his [competitor](http://microsoft.com/), that's for sure. The entire software industry is built on the back of his projects, but what he gets from society in exchange is largely unproportional. You could argue that anyone who starts an open source project doesn't expect the project to take off, and simply creates for the love of it. There was an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrHorwH5Pco) with TailwindCSS's creator that really made me question if we'll continue see open source projects take off. TailwindCSS dominates the web, and almost every new web company nowadays uses Tailwind. Tailwind on the other hand, can't monetize off of this. 

There are good examples of open source projects becoming companies and being able to monetize, but the way to do this is very indirect. Comma AI and [openpilot](https://comma.ai/openpilot) is is a great example. Make the software free, but pay for the hardware. This is a great option for a company doing hardware. But what if you're purely software? Vercel and NextJS are a great example. The software is open source, but the platform costs money. However, I'm less bullish on this. A conflict of interest arises. If you want to use the software, you're drawn into an ecosystem because the software is highly optimized for the [platform](https://x.com/amasad/status/1903222226637426807). I don't think this is bad for business, but I think its bad for creators who want to make their project truly open-source.

In the case of a styling framework like Tailwind, there doesn't seem to be any path forward. I'm not sure how you monetize something like it. Maybe it's a lack of imagination or maybe that's just the market in action optimizing for what society values. But if everyone uses something, doesn't that mean it's valuable? 

The first most widely used way to monetize open source is through donations. The BuyMeACoffee link, or the bitcoin address seems to be a good way to make money on an open source project. However, this is not nearly enough if you want to work on the open source project full-time. 

Raising a token might be another. Nadia Eghbal who I found out about through [Balaji Srinivasan](https://x.com/balajis/status/1326315049997094912) mentioned how people could create a token for an open source project. The more valuable the project, the higher the token price. 
I personally don't know how this would work in practice. If market prices were 100% accurate, it sounds like a great idea. But the real world doesn't work like that.

My personal opinion is that the problem might not be fixed by technology, but by culture. Monetization for game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine seem to work pretty well - outside of this [debacle](https://x.com/MattRix/status/1701616196049666377) that was slowly taken back. Offering the game engine for free, and only collecting profits once you game reaches profits is a great strategy to encourage indie developers to use the engine. This obviously is paralleled in software as well with a free tier, and a "pay as you go" monetization strategy. My general take is that we need some sort of cultural shift in the open source community towards dual licensing, or alternative licensing that lets people continue to use the software for free and only charge the companies and developers to pay back their dependencies once they've reached a certain level of success. 

I've never created a large open source project, so this is pure speculation. But my belief is that most open source maintainers create their project not thinking it will turn into a company. But as the project grows larger and larger, and the more time they put into it. At some point, it becomes a full-time job that you aren't getting paid for. And you certaintly can't quit either. Because if you quit, you let down all the people who love your project. Either way, we need to figure out a way to support open-source projects in such a way that is proportional to the value they create, before everyone starts closing their doors.
