So I graduated a couple of months ago with an undergrad in CS and been applying to new grad roles for about ~1 year now and have gotten a few interviews but no offers. I've applied to >700 places, A/B tested different resumes, and cold-emailed but still no luck. Is AI taking my job? Or am I just a noob?

New grad CS degrees are roughly at 6.1%, which is above the average unemployment rate at 5.8%. Now, the question is what is the primary factor causing unemployment for junior roles. Is it largely due to AI, or other market factors such as uncertainty for future profits or something else.

Recent [Microsoft Layoffs](https://example.com) reported that the company saved close to $500M for "AI integration", while the current revenue numbers as of today suggest that they are projected to make [~$270B](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/revenue) in 2025, seeing 14% increase year over year. 

Other big tech companies are also doing [layoffs](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/amazon-microsoft-meta-intel-and-more-list-of-top-us-tech-giants-that-have-announced-mass-layoffs-in-2025/articleshow/121989752.cms) but their job portals are still open with plenty of positions. Why are they still hiring if they are laying people off? Maybe it suggests roles are getting more competitive due to the supply. Or maybe these companies are being dishonest in increasing their actual headcount, or they are just too lazy to take their job postings down. 

If the premise of AI is to increase the productivity of an average engineer through tools such as Cursor or Claude Code, then shouldn't the companies be hiring even more? The opportunity to build more software in the age of AI would imply a higher demand for engineers, regardless of skill level. In fact, people who are at the top ladder are getting paid more than ever.

People are saying the new models are AGI, and if that's the case there's obviously no point to hire. But things like MCP and investment in other software infra tools suggest that developers will keep building, and Superintelligence is far away. 

My assumption is that companies are in the phase of figuring out what to work on, and they just have no idea. So they are cutting costs, until they have a vision of what the near future will look like, at which point they will start hiring aggressively again. None of these companies have balls and are scared to lose a bunch of money by making the wrong bet. 

Anyways, hopefully I get a job!!!!
