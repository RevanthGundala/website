  <section><p>So I graduated a couple of months ago with an undergrad in CS and been applying to new grad roles for about ~1 year now and have gotten a few interviews but no offers. I&rsquo;ve applied to &gt;700 places, A/B tested different resumes, and cold-emailed but still no luck. About 80% of the places I apply to are <a href="https://builtin.com/articles/ghost-jobs">ghost jobs</a>. Of course companies are not required to reject, but most apps that exist aren&rsquo;t even real. How is this even acceptable? Why do I get texts every day from Lisa from Indeed, who has a new gig opportunity for me to earn $500/day as a part time job? I have responded to Lisa multiple times, but I never get back a response!</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t even a &ldquo;talent&rdquo; problem. This is just companies boosting numbers, selling people&rsquo;s data, and waiting for the next 10x engineer to apply to their position. The system is broken, and we must fix it.</p>
<p>Ok, so how do we fix this? Well, as far as the law goes, states like NYC require <a href="%22https://abovethelaw.com/2024/05/should-governments-crack-down-on-fake-job-postings/%22">good faith</a> when posting job applications, and measuring <em>good faith</em> is impossible. There&rsquo;s no quantitative measurements to be able to enforce anything. They can post their jobs even without a real job opening, because one can always make the argument that the company will always be hiring, just only the top 0.001% of talent.</p>
<p>One option is to have a credibility system. The public votes on companies that do honest hiring, and companies that have higher votes get a higher status point on the list. This in theory works, but only works for smaller companies. Even large companies have ghost jobs, but there&rsquo;s no way to combat this. People will follow the money, and whoever has the most money can do whatever they want. Outside of the utopia, where everyone works for themselves or robots do all of our work (this one is subjective and also more likely), there will always be employers and employees. Unions have existed in the past to rebel against bad working conditions, but it has largely been outlaws by companies that lobby.</p>
<p>People thinking you can just fix this by creating &ldquo;AI interviews&rdquo;, or online assessments, or &ldquo;connecting talent to companies&rdquo; is all just trash. This has increasingly been less true over the past few years because these companies have no incentive to change their methods. There&rsquo;s so much supply of talent, and not enough demand that they can pick and choose whoever they want. This is largely due to how much monopoly exists among big tech, and how these companies are rent seeking and not innovating. There&rsquo;s no risk being taken because these companies are scared to fail and the laws that exist don&rsquo;t require them to create new things. Every company at the top focuses on acquisitions over anything. Microsoft acquired Github, Vscode, and &hellip; Meta acquired literally all of their apps. Apple acquired a bunch of early teams for their XR divisions. Google acquired deepmind which is literally carrying their entire org. All of it is just expanding their monoploy instead of driving true innovation.</p>
